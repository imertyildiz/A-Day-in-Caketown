Introduction 
During a typical day in Caketown, people all bake, serve and eat cakes:
 Suppliers bring cake stands to the cake ground. One Supplier at a time can enter the cake ground to place a stand 
inside and mark its availability on the board at the entrance. 
 CakeBakers bake sliced cakes, carry them to the entrance of the cake ground, and then wait there by checking the 
board till a cake stand becomes available. One CakeBaker at a time can enter the cake ground to put the cake on an 
empty stand and unmark its availability on the board. 
 CakeMonsters always wants to eat cakes. A CakeMonster directly runs to a stand randomly inside the cake ground and 
waits at that stand for a cake. Early-bird CakeMonsters, if any, must wait until the first stand Is put inside. One 
CakeMonster at a time can take a cake slice from one particular stand. Of course, there can be many CakeMonsters
taking slices from different stands concurrently. 
 No ordering or priority is specified about which Supplier or CakeBaker will enter the cake ground and which 
CakeMonster will get a cake slice.
